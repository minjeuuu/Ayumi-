  reflection: "Our journey with Christ is often less about the destination and more about the daily rhythm of trust. To walk by faith is to take the next step even when the horizon is clouded. It is a quiet confidence that He who called you is faithful to lead you. Today, do not worry about the miles ahead; simply focus on the step directly in front of you, trusting that His grace is sufficient for this moment.",
  prayer: "Lord, help me to trust You with my next step. Silence my fears about the future and ground me in the assurance of Your presence today. Amen.",
  stepOfFaith: "Take 5 minutes of silence today to simply be in God's presence, asking Him for guidance on one specific decision you face."
